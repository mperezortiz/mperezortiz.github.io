I am Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). 

I work in `planet-centered AI`, developing responsible AI technologies for people, the planet and tackling the `challenges of the Anthropocene`. E.g.: 
How can we leverage AI to faithfully capture `the dynamics of our social and environmental ecosystems`, creating `digital twins`?
How could we leverage these computational systems for `planetary governance` (e.g. climate change policy crafting)? How to make AI more `responsible, ethical, robust, transparent, accountable`...? How do we create `a new hybrid intelligence`, that is neither artificial nor human, but rather a mix of both of our strengths?
I am looking for `PhD students` to work on these topics, if you are interested please send me an email with your research proposal.

I am currently working on bringing `sustainability and responsible innovation` to the computer science arena. I am Deputy Director of the first [MSc program on AI for Sustainable Development](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/artificial-intelligence-sustainable-development-msc), as well as module leader of two courses at UCL: i) [AI for Sustainable Development](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/ai-for-sustainable-development-COMP0173) and ii) [Transparent, Accountable and Responsible AI](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/accountable-transparent-and-responsible-artificial-intelligence-COMP0195).


`Interests`: AI for sustainability and governance; Recommendation Systems; Human-AI collaboration; Responsible AI; Simulation Intelligence and Digital Twins.
