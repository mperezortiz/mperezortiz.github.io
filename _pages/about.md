`Current research interests`: AI for sustainability and governance; Recommendation Systems; Human-AI collaboration; Responsible AI; Simulation Intelligence and Digital Twins.

I am looking for `PhD students` to join work on these topics through the [Foundational AI CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/foundational-ai-cdt/foundational-artificial-intelligence-mphilphd), if you are interested please send me an email with an introduction, your CV and a short research proposal.

I am currently working on bringing `sustainability and responsible innovation` to the computer science arena. I am co-director of the first [`MSc program on AI for Sustainable Development`](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/artificial-intelligence-sustainable-development-msc), as well as module leader of two courses at UCL: i) [AI for Sustainable Development](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/ai-for-sustainable-development-COMP0173) and ii) [Transparent, Accountable and Responsible AI](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/accountable-transparent-and-responsible-artificial-intelligence-COMP0195).

I work in what I call `planet-centered AI`, developing responsible AI technologies for people, the planet and the `challenges of the human-led era of the Anthropocene` (e.g. need for solutions for climate change mitigation & adaptation and supporting policy makers). So far, my contributions on the development and real-world deployment of these technologies have had impact in areas as diverse as biomedicine, environmental sustainability and educational technology.

I am interested in questions such as: How can we leverage AI to faithfully capture `the dynamics of our social and environmental ecosystems`, creating `digital twins`?
How could we leverage these computational systems for `governance`? How to make AI more `responsible, ethical, robust, transparent, accountable`...? How do we create `a new hybrid collaborative and interactive intelligence`, that is neither artificial nor human, but rather a mix of both of our strengths?
