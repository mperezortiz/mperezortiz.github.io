I am Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). Previously, I was Senior Research Fellow at the same department and Research Associate at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/). 

I work in what I often call planet-centered artificial intelligence: developing responsible and innovative AI technologies for people, the planet and tackling the challenges of the Anthropocene. Generally, my research aims to build more humane AI technologies that consider planetary ethics, social and environmental impact and overall empower humans to address global sustainability challenges.

I am currently working on bringing sustainability and responsible innovation topics to the computer science arena. I am Deputy Director of the first [MSc program on AI for Sustainable Development](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/artificial-intelligence-sustainable-development-msc), as well as module leader of two courses at UCL: i) [AI for Sustainable Development](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/ai-for-sustainable-development-COMP0173) and ii) [Transparent, Accountable and Responsible AI](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/accountable-transparent-and-responsible-artificial-intelligence-COMP0195).

In 2022, I worked on creating the [first conference on human-centered AI](https://www.hhai-conference.org/), and I am part of its steering committee now. 

I sometimes write poems on tech and sustainability in my blog [The AI has gone bananas](http://www.bananas.ai/). 

`Interests`: responsible AI; environmental digital twinning; sustainable agritech; recommender systems and simulation intelligence for policy making; education for sustainability.
