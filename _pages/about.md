I am Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). Previously, I was Senior Research Fellow at the same department and Research Associate at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/). 

Having worked in the last 12 years in topics related to biomedicine, sustainable agriculture, climate change and environmental modelling, neuroscience and educational technology, I am now interested in building tech responsibility frameworks to address global sustainability challenges.

I am currently working on bringing sustainability and responsible innovation topics to the computer science arena. I am deputy co-lead of the first [MSc program on AI for Sustainable Development](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/artificial-intelligence-sustainable-development-msc), as well as module leader of two courses at UCL: i) [AI for Sustainable Development](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/ai-for-sustainable-development-COMP0173) and ii) [Transparent, Accountable and Responsible AI](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/accountable-transparent-and-responsible-artificial-intelligence-COMP0195).

In 2022, I worked on creating the [first conference on human-centered AI](https://www.hhai-conference.org/), and I am part of its steering committee now. 


I sometimes write poems on tech and sustainability in my blog [The AI has gone bananas](http://www.bananas.ai/). 

`Interests`: environmental digital twinning, agritech for ensuring food security, recommender systems, simulation intelligence for policy making, education for sustainability.
