Below I summarise the research lines in which I am currently working. Since my research and teaching are very interlinked these are also the topics that I am currently lecturing on. If you work on similar topics feel free to reach out and say hi! 

If you are a student at UCL interested in these please let me know, I may have projects related to them. 


`Sustainability Challenges`: <br /> Part of my work revolves around creating predictive models for solving real world global challenges. In the past I have worked on biomedicine, agriculture, climate change, neuroscience and education challenges. See my latest work on this line [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25257-4), where we create a deep learning model to predict changes in polar sea ice.

`Responsible AI`: <br /> Responsible AI covers many topics, such as transparency, ethics, accountability, privacy, fairness and human-AI interaction. Recently I am working on estimating and governing reliably the performance of ML models. See my latest work on this line [here](https://jmlr.org/papers/v22/20-879.html), where we bring risk certification to deep learning algorithms.

`Simulation Intelligence/Digital Twinning for Policy Making`: <br />
One of my main research interests is pairing simulations with AI to discover and craft potential sustainable paths that could inform public health as well as environmental regulations and strategies. See my latest work on this line [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11786-5), where we show the importance of deriving large-scale simulation experiments covering a wide range of parameters, in order to devise appropriate public health interventions in infections diseases.

`Critical studies of technology`: <br /> This line focuses on reflective assessment and speculative critique of technology, with the objective of revealing potential risks and maluses. It shows the importance of engaging with problems in ways that put social and political concerns at the epicenter. See my latest work [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02034), where we discuss how the EdTech field could exacerbate educational inequality, if the objectives of the field are not aligned adequately with current educational challenges.
