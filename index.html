                                    Summary:
                                    The goal of psychometric scaling is the quantification of perceptual experiences,
                                    understanding the relationship between
                                    an external stimulus, the internal representation and the response.
                                    We propose a probabilistic framework
                                    to fuse the outcome of different psychophysical experimental protocols, namely
                                    rating and pairwise comparisons. Such a method can be used for merging
                                    datasets of subjective
                                    nature and for experiments in which
                                    both measurements are collected. This is a stepping stone for computational social
                                    choice.
