    <p>Results of an audit study conducted during the 2016 election cycle
  demonstrate that bias toward Latinos observed during the 2012
  election has persisted. In addition to replicating previous results,
  we show that Arab/Muslim Americans face an even greater barrier to
  communicating with local election officials, but we find no evidence
  of bias toward blacks. An innovation of our design allows us to
  measure whether emails were opened by recipients, which we argue
  provides a direct test of implicit discrimination. We find evidence
  of implicit bias toward Arab/Muslim senders only.</p>

    <p>Does pre-existing preference based on skin tone,
                  facial features, and other observable
                  characteristics, i.e., phenotypic preference, affect
                  immigrant voters’ support for political candidates
                  competing in their countries of origin? Do these
                  preferences change as migrants’ tenure in their host
                  society increases? These questions are important for
                  ethnic and racial politics in general, and
                  particularly for the sizable foreign-born population
                  in the United States, which includes 11 million
                  Mexicans. Using a unique, random sample of
                  foreign-born Mexicans in San Diego County, we employ
                  a voting experiment to test the impact of skin tone
                  and phenotype on vote choice among first generation
                  immigrants. Our design allows us to distinguish
                  responses to different phenotypic cues by exposing
                  respondents to European, mestizo, and indigenous
                  looking candidates competing in a hypothetical
                  Mexican election. Migrants showed higher support for
                  the Indigenous candidate, and evaluated the European
                  and Mestizo candidates as more ideologically
                  conservative. As migrants’ time in the United States
                  increases, the preference for indigenous features
                  gives way to a preference for whiteness, which we
                  interpret as evidence of first generation migrants
                  adopting the dominant racial ideology of the United
                  States. While ethnic distinctions have long been
                  viewed as a key component of voting behavior, our
                  research demonstrates that, even within a single
                  ethnicity, racial differences may have profound
                  impacts on the evaluation of and support for
                  electoral candidates. This study contributes to the
                  research on race and political behavior in
                  comparative perspective, as well as the political
                  consequences of migration.</p>

    <p>Millions of California voters regularly turn out in
                  November but abstain from primary elections. A
                  randomized Get Out the Vote experiment conducted in
                  the state’s 2014 primary contest shows that this
                  dormant electorate can be mobilized if campaigns
                  target these unlikely voters. Here, we extend these
                  findings to examine whether the electoral context of
                  the district shapes the effectiveness of a primary
                  mobilization effort. To do so, we develop two
                  conceptualizations of campaign context. The first is
                  based on a district’s typical level of
                  competitiveness. The second looks at total spending
                  levels in the current campaign. Theories of voter
                  information processing predict differential
                  responsiveness by voters to mobilization efforts in
                  these different contexts.To test these predictions,
                  we analyze a field experiment that sends direct mail
                  to 149,596 registered low-propensity California
                  voters. Consistent with theory, we find that voter
                  mobilization mailings have different effects in these
                  two distinct contexts. Although mobilization efforts
                  always increase turnout, in districts that are
                  typically competitive we find that mobilization
                  efforts are more effective</p>

    <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex global
                  problem, not only because it is a human rights
                  issue, but also because it is associated with
                  chronic mental and physical illnesses as well as
                  acute health outcomes related to injuries for women
                  and their children. Attitudes, beliefs, and norms
                  regarding IPV are significantly associated with the
                  likelihood of both IPV experience and
                  perpetration. Our results show that differential
                  targeting of individuals and relationships in order
                  to reduce the acceptability and, subsequently, the
                  prevalence of IPV may be most effective. Because IPV
                  norms seem to be strongly held within households,
                  the household is probably the most logical unit to
                  target in order to implement change. This approach
                  would include the possible benefit of a generational
                  effect. Finally, in social contexts in which
                  perpetration of IPV is not socially acceptable, the
                  most effective strategy may be to implement change
                  not at the center but at the periphery of the
                  community.</p>

    <p>One of the best-known and most replicated laboratory
                  results in behavioral economics is that bargainers
                  frequently reject low offers, even when it harms
                  their material self-interest. This finding could
                  have important implications for international
                  negotiations on many problems facing humanity today,
                  because models of international bargaining assume
                  exactly the opposite: that policy makers are
                  rational and self-interested. However, it is unknown
                  whether elites who engage in diplomatic bargaining
                  will similarly reject low offers because past
                  research has been based almost exclusively on
                  convenience samples of undergraduates, members of
                  the general public, or small-scale societies rather
                  than highly experienced elites who design and
                  bargain over policy. Using a unique sample of 102
                  policy and business elites who have an average of 21
                  y of practical experience conducting international
                  diplomacy or policy strategy, we show that, compared
                  with undergraduates and the general public, elites
                  are actually more likely to reject low offers when
                  playing a standard “ultimatum game” that assesses
                  how players bargain over a fixed resource. Elites
                  with more experience tend to make even higher
                  demands, suggesting that this tendency only
                  increases as policy makers advance to leadership
                  positions. This result contradicts assumptions of
                  rational self-interested behavior that are standard
                  in models of international bargaining, and it
                  suggests that the adoption of global agreements on
                  international trade, climate change, and other
                  important problems will not depend solely on the
                  interests of individual countries, but also on
                  whether these accords are seen as equitable to all
                  member states.</p>

    <p>Experimental evidence in cognitive psychology and
                  behavioral economics is transforming the way
                  political science scholars think about how humans
                  make decisions in areas of high complexity,
                  uncertainty, and risk. Nearly all those studies
                  utilize convenience samples of university students,
                  but in the real world political elites actually make
                  most pivotal political decisions such as threatening
                  war or changing the course of economic
                  policy. Highly experienced elites are more likely to
                  exhibit the attributes of rational decision making;
                  and over the last fifteen years a wealth of studies
                  suggest that such elites are likely to be more
                  skilled in strategic bargaining than samples with
                  less germane experience. However, elites are also
                  more likely to suffer overconfidence, which degrades
                  decision making skills. We illustrate implications
                  for political science with a case study of crisis
                  bargaining between the US and North
                  Korea. Variations in the experience of US elite
                  decision-makers between 2002 and 2006 plausibly
                  explain the large shift in US crisis signaling
                  better than other rival hypotheses such as “Iraq
                  fatigue.” Beyond crisis bargaining other major
                  political science theories might benefit from
                  attention to the attributes of individual
                  decision makers.</p>
