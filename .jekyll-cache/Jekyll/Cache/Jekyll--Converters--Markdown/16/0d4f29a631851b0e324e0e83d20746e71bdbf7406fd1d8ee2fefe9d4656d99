I"Ó<p>I am Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/">Dept. of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>. Previously, I was Senior Research Fellow at the same department and Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>.</p>

<p>I have worked in the last 12 years in topics related to biomedicine, sustainable agriculture, climate change and environmental modelling, neuroscience and educational technology. Nowadays I am interested in building the technical and responsibility foundations needed to address global sustainability challenges, specifically regarding environmental modelling and policy.</p>

<p>I am currently working on bringing sustainability and responsible innovation topics to the computer science arena. I am deputy co-lead of the first <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/artificial-intelligence-sustainable-development-msc">MSc program on AI for Sustainable Development</a>, as well as module leader of two courses at UCL: i) <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/ai-for-sustainable-development-COMP0173">AI for Sustainable Development</a> and ii) <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/accountable-transparent-and-responsible-artificial-intelligence-COMP0195">Transparent, Accountable and Responsible AI</a>.</p>

<p>In 2022, I worked on creating the <a href="https://www.hhai-conference.org/">first conference on human-centered AI</a>, and I am part of its steering committee now.</p>

<p>I sometimes write poems on tech and sustainability in my blog <a href="http://www.bananas.ai/">The AI has gone bananas</a>.</p>
