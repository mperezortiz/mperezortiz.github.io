I"j<p>I am module leader of two courses at UCL. I will be uploading here some materials related to these courses. Watch this space for updates!</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AI for Sustainable Development</code>: <br /> This module introduces students to sustainability concepts, as well as different theories of development, showing where both sustainability and development meet. Specifically, the module introduces the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and shows how different AI techniques could both act as an SDG enabler and an inhibitor. The module also discusses some of the most pressing environmental, social and economic challenges we humans are facing and presents a framework to ask questions related to the impact of AI technologies. As part of the course, we engage in inquisitive and analytical speculation during our discussion and paper reading sessions. The module is also inherently linked to governance and ethics and points to many of those works. The module features guest speakers who are doing research in one of the verticals of sustainability and presents students with code tutorials regarding some of the most impactful AI developments for sustainability (e.g. remote sensing, simulation intelligence, etc.).

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Transparent, Accountable and Responsible AI</code>: <br /> Part of my work revolves around creating predictive models for solving real world global challenges. In the past I have worked on biomedicine, agriculture, climate change, neuroscience and education challenges. See my latest work on this line <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25257-4">here</a>, where we create a deep learning model to predict changes in polar sea ice.</p>
