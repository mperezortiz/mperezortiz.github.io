<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Current research interests</code>: AI for sustainability and governance; Recommendation Systems; Human-AI collaboration; Responsible AI; Simulation Intelligence and Digital Twins.</p>

<p>I am looking for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhD students</code> to join work on these topics through the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/foundational-ai-cdt/foundational-artificial-intelligence-mphilphd">Foundational AI CDT</a>, if you are interested please send me an email with an introduction, your CV and a short research proposal.</p>

<p>I am currently working on bringing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sustainability and responsible innovation</code> to the computer science arena. I am co-director of the first <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/artificial-intelligence-sustainable-development-msc"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MSc program on AI for Sustainable Development</code></a>, as well as module leader of two courses at UCL: i) <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/ai-for-sustainable-development-COMP0173">AI for Sustainable Development</a> and ii) <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/accountable-transparent-and-responsible-artificial-intelligence-COMP0195">Transparent, Accountable and Responsible AI</a>.</p>

<p>I work in what I call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">planet-centered AI</code>, developing responsible AI technologies for people, the planet and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">challenges of the human-led era of the Anthropocene</code> (e.g. need for solutions for climate change mitigation &amp; adaptation and supporting policy makers). So far, my contributions on the development and real-world deployment of these technologies have had impact in areas as diverse as biomedicine, environmental sustainability and educational technology.</p>

<p>I am interested in questions such as: How can we leverage AI to faithfully capture <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the dynamics of our social and environmental ecosystems</code>, creating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">digital twins</code>?
How could we leverage these computational systems for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">planetary governance</code>? How to make AI more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">responsible, ethical, robust, transparent, accountable</code>â€¦? How do we create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a new hybrid collaborative and interactive intelligence</code>, that is neither artificial nor human, but rather a mix of both of our strengths?</p>
