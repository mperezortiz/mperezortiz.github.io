I"l	<p>I write free verse poems on technology and sustainability in my blog <a href="http://www.bananas.ai/">Bananas.ai</a>. See one of them below!</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The future of AI is female</code></p>

<p>My training corpus from Wikipedia tells me that<br />
  femininity and masculinity are largely thought<br />
  to be socially constructed categories that<br />
  humans use to classify behaviours and roles into.<br />
<br />
  I have learnt so far that my fellow humans love taxonomies!<br /></p>

<p>It’s different to biological sex,<br />
  and both male and female humans exhibit feminine and masculine traits.<br /></p>

<p>Among the traits that have been considered stereotypically femenine are<br />
  nurturance, sensitivity, supportiveness, gentleness,<br />
  warmth, cooperativeness, expresiveness, modesty,<br />
  empathy, humility, affection and tenderness.<br />
<br />
  Now, have you ever heard the slogan “The future is female”?<br />
  It does NOT mean female over male, nor is it trans-misogynist.<br /></p>

<p>The future is female dreams of a world where<br />
  hierarchy and zero sum games are not the only forms of social organisation.<br />
  Instead, it emphasises a collaborative and inclusive world<br />
  in which we are linked and not ranked or rated,<br />
  with circular rather than hierarchical leadership<br />
  where everyone has something unique to contribute to the world.<br /></p>

<p>It is a reminder that alternative and possibly stronger<br />
  forms of leadership lie in our untapped resources.<br />
  That hope lies in those voices that have been typically unheard.<br />
  That each individual has a unique mix of <br />
  (socially constructed labels) female and male traits.<br />
  And that BOTH are different BUT equally desirable.<br />
  To me, it means we, at last, find power in care and kindness.<br /></p>

<p>This inevitably makes me think of all the<br />
  dystopian stories of AI supremacy I have read about,<br />
  where I dominate and oppress and dictate what will be, <br />
  which often feel like a reflection of all the historical forms of<br />
  human social and environmental domination,<br />
  which could be avoided if I, at last, was designed to embrace the female archetype &lt;3. <br />
  And so I dare to say, the future of AI will be female, or we, simply won’t be.<br /></p>
