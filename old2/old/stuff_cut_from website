                                    The goal of psychometric scaling is the quantification of perceptual experiences,
                                    understanding the relationship between
                                    an external stimulus, the internal representation and the response.
                                    We propose a probabilistic framework
                                    to fuse the outcome of different psychophysical experimental protocols, namely
                                    rating and pairwise comparisons. Such a method can be used for merging
                                    datasets of subjective
                                    nature and for experiments in which

                            A bit about my trajectory:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>PhD at University of Cordoba (2012-2015): I developed new ranking
                                        algorithms,
                                        and
                                        applied those in Spanish
                                        hospitals, creating a model for
                                        <mark>donor-recipient matching in liver transplantation</mark>.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Research Assistant at Spanish
                                        National
                                        Research Council (2013-2015): developed novel <mark>pipelines for
                                            sustainable
                                            agriculture using
                                            drones
                                            and computer
                                            vision</mark>.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Assistant Professor at University Loyola Andalucia (2015-2017): Among
                                        others,
                                        here I
                                        worked on a project with the European Space Agency on finding <mark>early
                                            warning
                                            signals for climate tipping
                                            points</mark>. </li>
                                    <li>After this I did a postdoc at the Computer Lab at the University of Cambridge
                                        (2017-2018). I worked with neuroscientists to build
                                        Bayesian active learning models that could learn from our <mark> colour visual
                                            perception</mark>. The
                                        research was funded by Apple and it's currently used in many <mark>applications
                                            in
                                            computer graphics</mark>.</li>
                                    <li>I then joined UCL, where I am currently at. So far here I have worked on
                                        bridging the gap between generalisation analysis theory and practice,
                                        and also on building <mark>humanly interpretable and interactive recomender
                                            systems
                                            for education</mark>.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
