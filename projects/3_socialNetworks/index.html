<p>Individuals who take political action don’t live in isolation. They
talk with one another, sometimes about politics. We’ve known and
accepted this reality in modern political science at least since the
1940s. However, for decades we rarely took this seriously when testing
models of political action – our political science theories weren’t
well-enough developed and the models intractable.</p>

<p>However, in the past decade new developments in measurement, computing,
and theory have led scholars to again examine explanations for
political action that extend beyond the individual.</p>

<p>In this project, I develop a theory that predicts <em>when</em> and <em>how</em>
connections between individuals can lead groups to coordinate on a
common purpose. Individuals gather information about others in their
everyday lives – who knows whom, who is respected in the community –
and when asked to take action they utilize this information.</p>

<p>To test this theory, I gathered face-to-face social network data from
5,000 people living in rural Honduras, constructing the first-ever
social network mapping of more than 30 towns in this remote region.</p>

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two" src="/assets/img/laUnion.jpg" alt="" title="La Union" />
    <img class="col one" src="/assets/img/Juan.jpg" alt="" title="Juan" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Main street, La Union. I conducted research in more than 30 villages in the local area.
    Juan worked with us during his summer break.
</div>

<p>After collecting this social network information from residents, we
partnered with a local development agency to hold informational
meetings, but we <strong>experimentally manipulated</strong> where, in the social
network, the information about this meeting was seeded. In some cases,
we seeded this information with individuals who held <em>many</em> social
connections in the community; in other cases we seeded this
information with individuals who held very <em>few</em> social connections in
the community.</p>

<p>Consistent with theoretical predictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information and attendance at the meeting was associated with social
distance – the better connected to a mobilizer was a resident, the
more likely she or he was to attend the meeting;</li>
  <li>The more social connections a randomly selected mobilizer held, the more residents she or he brought to the meeting.</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one" src="/assets/img/wholeNet.jpg" alt="" title="Social Network" /> 
    <img class="col two" src="/assets/img/mobilization.jpg" alt="" title="turnout" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    On the right is a village meeting, where one mobilizer was socially well connected
    and while another mobilizer was socially poorly connected. In the social network
    of the community, plotted on the left, the well connected mobilizer is in purple
    and the poorly connected mobilizer in blue.
